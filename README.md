Constraint Programming Lectures
===============================

This is a work in progress.

These are my constraint programming lectures, which are part of a larger
course:

They cover limited discrepancy search, and parallelism. This is material for
final year undergraduates and Masters students, so it's an overview of some of
the important or interesting aspects, not a comprehensive summary of
everything.
